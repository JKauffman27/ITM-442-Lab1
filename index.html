		<h1>ITM 442 Introductory Website</h1>
		<h2>By Jordan Kauffman</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my page! I am excited to begin working in this class! Get to know me below!</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>As said in the introduction statement, my name is Jordan Kauffman (image shown below). While I do not consider myself to be extremely affluent with computers, I love learning about them more and more with each class I take. This will be the third class I have taken over specifically web-development (aside from breif experience in highschool). I have found that I am not horribly opposed to most of the tools used in web-development as much as I initially thought (I am not a big fan of raw programming). In short, I hope that this class will help elevate my understanding further, as well as teach me a few new tricks along the way.</p>

		<h2>Personal Stuff</h2>
		<p>Aside from classes and school experience, I'll throw in some other information about myself. Currently, I am working a full time job with the company Bastion Distribution as one of the main customer service representatives. I have worked with the parent company, Heng's, for a long time, seeing as my father also works for them. When not working or doing homework, I mostly like to play games. Unfortunately, it seems that League of Legends is the one that takes most of my time, but I also dabble mostly in Indie games like Darkest Dungeon and Balatro. Being the nerd that I am, I also watch a lot of anime. Nothing specific, mind you, mostly just whatever I feel like watching. Although, I will say that Cowboy Bebop is my favorite of all-time so far. I guess if you ever want more specific information about me, feel free to reach out. Discord is the place I will most likely be found, otherwise I tend to respond to emails fairly quick if I see where or who it's from. Thanks for reading!</p>
